    <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; font-size: 50px;"><u><strong>We are Multitalented</strong></u></h1>

    <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 30px;">The main goal of this website is mainly to 
        showcase the different uses of a website. This website has a space for a calculator used for basic 
        calsulations. We also feature an <a href="Art.html"><strong>Art Gallery</strong></a> made by 
        <u>Adedayo Ganiyyah</u> as she showcases her projects. 
        Her drawings are of anime and steps are written to the side of the image.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 30px;">My website doesn't really focus on anything 
        but maybe just to showcase different projects intertwined together. It has a calculator that performs basic 
        equations. There is also a todo-list to help if you need to do something on time. I helps keep track of 
        what you've done and what you haven't done. 
    </p> 
        
    <p style="font-size: 40px; margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 30px;">Then we also have the contact page. it links to the company's 
        email so you can send an email if you have any questions regarding the website or you want to communicate 
        about putting you project or painting in the website. Please fill the contact form and we will always try 
        our best to give immediate replies. Thank you for visiting our ACKOO multitalented website. 
        Please have a good day.
